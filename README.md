Say goodbye to forgotten leftovers and expired groceries. With FridgePal, you'll always know what you have, when it expires, and how to use it before it goes bad!

## Tech Stack

- **React Native** ‚Äì Mobile app framework
- **Expo** ‚Äì Development platform and tools
- **Expo Router** ‚Äì File-based navigation
- **Expo Notifications** ‚Äì Push notification system
- **Expo Task Manager** ‚Äì Background notification processing
- **NativeWind** ‚Äì Tailwind CSS for React Native
- **TypeScript** ‚Äì Type safety
- **Supabase** ‚Äì Backend database, auth & storage
- **Supabase Auth** ‚Äì User authentication and session management
- **OpenAI Vision API** ‚Äì AI-powered food recognition
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Database (via Supabase)

## Architecture

This is a full-stack mobile application featuring:
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo for cross-platform mobile development
- **Backend**: Supabase for database, authentication, and file storage
- **Notifications**: Smart notification system with background scheduling
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Vision API for intelligent food recognition
- **Security**: User authentication with data isolation and session persistence

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Database Schema

The app uses PostgreSQL via Supabase with user authentication and data isolation:
- **products** - Food items with expiration tracking (user-specific)
- **categories** - Food categories (fruits, vegetables, etc.)
- **Storage bucket** - Product images with secure access

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration to ensure code quality and catch issues early.

### What Gets Checked Automatically:

Every time you push code or create a pull request, our CI pipeline automatically runs:

- ‚úÖ **Code Quality** - ESLint checks for style and best practices
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety** - TypeScript verification to catch type errors
- ‚úÖ **Security** - npm audit to find vulnerable dependencies

### Workflow Triggers:

- **Push to `main`** - Full CI pipeline runs
- **Pull Requests to `main`** - All checks must pass before merging

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Expo CLI** (will be installed automatically)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CatAvadani/FridgePal.git
cd FridgePal
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Get an OpenAI API key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
3. Create a `.env` file and add your credentials

### 3. Set Up Database

Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL editor for products and categories

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npx expo start
```

After running this command, you'll see a QR code and several options to run the app.

## Running on Devices

### Option 1: Expo Go (Easiest for Testing)

1. **Install Expo Go** on your phone:
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

2. **Scan the QR code** displayed in your terminal with:
   - **iOS**: Camera app or Expo Go app
   - **Android**: Expo Go app

### Option 2: iOS Simulator (macOS only)

```bash
npx expo start
# Press 'i' in the terminal to open iOS simulator
```

### Option 3: Development Build (For Full Notification Support on Android)

For the complete notification experience on Android:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Build development version
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Install the APK on your Android device
```
